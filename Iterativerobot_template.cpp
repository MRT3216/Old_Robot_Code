/* The Iterative Robot base class assists with the most common 
 * code structure by handling the state transitions and looping 
 * in the base class instead of in the robot code. For each 
 * state (autonomous, teleop, disabled, test) there are two 
 * methods that are called:
 *
 * Init methods - The init method for a given state is called 
 * each time the corresponding state is entered (for example, a 
 * transition from disabled to teleop will call teleopInit()). 
 * Any initialization code or resetting of variables between 
 * modes should be placed here.
 *
 * Periodic methods - The periodic method for a given state is 
 * called each time the robot receives a Driver Station packet 
 * in the corresponding state, approximately every 20ms. This 
 * means that all of the code placed in each periodic method 
 * should finish executing in 20ms or less. The idea is to put 
 * code here that gets values from the driver station and updates 
 * the motors. You can read the joysticks and other driverstation 
 * inputs more often, but youâ€™ll only get the previous value until 
 * a new update is received. By synchronizing with the received 
 * updates your program will put less of a load on the cRIO CPU 
 * leaving more time for other tasks such as camera processing.
 *
 * It also has a test method, just like SimpleRobot.  I have no
 * idea what it does, and it is disabled during competition.

 * time actions by way of 
 * if(loopcounter%10){//do something}
 * wherein loopcounter is your

 * you want to wait between your
