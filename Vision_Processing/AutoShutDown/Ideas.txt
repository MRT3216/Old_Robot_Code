How would this be implimented in a custom dashbard?  It wouldn't.  It would be especially heplful for an onboard corocessor.  Here's one idea.  Through NetworkTables (running on the robot), you could have a variable incrimenting every 5 seconds and a boolean to check whether or not the robot is currently in autonomous.  On the custom dashboard, you would check for two things.  Check if the robot is currently in autonomous, and if so, check every ten seconds or so to see whether or not the variable has incrimented.  If not, the robot must be disabled, so you can send the command to shut down.
