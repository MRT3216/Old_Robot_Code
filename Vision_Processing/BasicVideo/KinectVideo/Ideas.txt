The simplest most basic way to gather an image from a Kinect.  The camera has three output streams:  RGB, infrared, and depth. The most you can view at a time is two, and you can not view the depth image and the infrared image at the same time (so the options are IR, RGB, Depth, IR & RGB, and Depth & RGB). In order to use any of this, you need to install OpenNI 2, Simple-OpenNI, and the Kinect SDK.  All three are included in the zip file, but it is not recommended that you use them unless there is no other option, because they WILL be outdated.
