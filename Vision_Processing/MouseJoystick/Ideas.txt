MouseJoystick is just what it sounds like.  It takes the mouse and maps its x-speed from -1 to +1 just like a joystick.  This could be used for precision movements and times when no other prehiperals are available.  Example1 allows the user to visualize the PVector and shows the "speed" values which would be sent to the robot.  Example1 shows how precise it can be by visualizing a rotating square (representing the robot).  If you need Y axis input, it's nearly identical to the x axis input, and fairly self explanitory of how to do it.
