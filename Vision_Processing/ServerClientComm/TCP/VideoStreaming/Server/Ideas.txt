How to use...
In case you have no idea what you're doing or how to test this program out by yourself, here's an explanation of the two easiest ways to ceck that the program is in fact working.  First:  open an internet browser and type "localhost:60010" without quotes. You should see the text coming through after a little while.  Localhost is what is known as the "loopback interface", shich is a dedicated IP address (254.0.0.1) that can be used to send network infromation to and from the same computer without a network in-between.  60010, in case you couldn't tell, is the port which has been chosen to run the server on.  Ports below 1040 ae often being utilized by other processes (Skype, Chrome, P2P, etc), so picking any port above that should suffice (make sure you use that port when typing the server URL into the web browser).  The second option will allow you to send data to any computer connected to the network.  First, open command prompt one the server machine and type in "ipconfig" (on Windows Vista/7) and scroll through the informationn until you get to the part that says "IPv4 address: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx".  This series of numbers is the IP you will use to connect to the server.  n another computer, open an internet browser and 
type that series of numbers followed by the server port like this: "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:60010" without quites, and the x's replaced with your IPv4 address.  If it works the output should be the same as the output wen using LocalHost.  MJPEG streaming is supposedly supported by all major browsers, but the only one this properly works with is FireFox.  It does, however, work with most dedicated MJPEG clients (such as the DriverStation)
